# FarmerChain - Testing & Verification Guide

## 🎯 Critical Bug Fixes Completed

### ✅ 1. Authentication Persistence - FIXED
**Issue**: User not staying logged in after authentication  
**Solution**:
- Fixed logout function to remove both `authUser` and `authToken` from localStorage
- WalletConnect component now properly passes token to App.jsx
- Header component reads user state correctly
- User state persists across page refreshes

**Test Steps**:
1. Click "Connect Wallet" button
2. Select MetaMask or HashPack
3. Sign the authentication message
4. Verify Header shows user avatar with wallet address
5. Refresh page - user should still be logged in
6. Click avatar dropdown - should show wallet address and menu

### ✅ 2. Navigation Overlay - FIXED
**Issue**: Header overlapping content on all pages except home  
**Solution**:
- Added `padding-top: 80px` to all page containers
- ProductsPage has proper spacing
- Cart, Checkout, and other pages now display correctly

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to Products page - content should not be hidden behind header
2. Navigate to Cart page - header should not overlap
3. Navigate to Checkout - form should be fully visible
4. Check all other pages for proper spacing

### ✅ 3. Product Images - FIXED
**Issue**: All products using same placeholder image  
**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive mock data with 28 diverse products
- Each category has unique, relevant images from Unsplash
- Coffee, Grains, Fruits, Vegetables, Spices, Dairy, Livestock all have proper imagery

**Test Steps**:
1. Browse products on home page - each product should have unique image
2. Filter by category - images should match category (e.g., coffee images for coffee products)
3. Check products page - all 28 products should have distinct images

### ✅ 4. Mock Data - ADDED

- Created 28 diverse agricultural products
- 5 Coffee products (Sidama, Yirgacheffe, Harrar, Guji, Limu)

**Solution**:
- Simplified payment flow using connected wallet
- Removed manual wallet address input (uses authenticated wallet)
- Implemented mock transaction processing
- Added transaction history storage

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Mock Data)

4. **Database**: Using localStorage instead of proper database
5. **Image Loading**: Using Unsplash URLs (may have rate limits)
